# NXThemes - Cursor Animation Color
NXThemes - Cursor Animation Color - Layout Patch
Hey there, I am the Original Content Creator of the Very First NXThemes Cursor Color Mod.

My heart goes to Exelix & Migush <3 Guys, seriously this took a long time to figure out.

As they were constantly bothered by me, over something that was still not quite understood/mastered yet for an official release. They guided me in the right direction, taught me, explained their attempts at trying to color change the cursor in past. Until one day~ exclaimed success

Let know tell y'all, this required at least 300 different .nxthemes to be tested to troubleshoot how the animation works.. They are such incredible people. <3

I'd love to see the Community take this original code and explore how to make different color animations.. :) .. Moderators are excited by this milestone advancement; please I encourage you to incorporate it in your themes.
