# NX-Themes---Cursor-Animation-Color
NX Themes - Cursor Animation Color - Layout Patch
Hey there, I am the Original Content Creator of the Very First NXThemes Cursor Color Mod.

My heart goes to Exelix & Migush <3 Guys, seriously this took a long time to figure out.

As they were constantly bothered by me, over something that was still not quite understood/mastered yet for an official release. They guided me in the right direction, taught me, explained their attempts at trying to color change the cursor in past. Until one day~ exclaimed success

Let know tell y'all, this required at least 300 different .nxthemes to be tested to troubleshoot how the animation works.. They are such incredible people. <3

I'd love to see the Community take this original code and explore how to make different color animations.. :) .. Moderators are excited by this milestone advancement; please I encourage you to incorporate it in your themes.

I'm here today to share an updated version of the Rainbow Pastel Cursor Included in my theme!

- Home, All Apps, Settings, User Page and Player Select

What it includes..

- Rainbow Pastel Cursor Animation (Working on all menus and system pop-up notifications)

- My Applets and Icons (There is extensive color modification done in the .json)

- Instagram Logo, Cute Moon, and Left Animal Crossing Joycon Controller has pastel pink to purple buttons, similar to the All Apps squares.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS: For Homescreen

You MUST paste the code in a Common Layout AND the Main Layout

Increase the border size from default (5) to 6 or 7 to show it off even more! :)
